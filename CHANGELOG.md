autouseradd adheres to [Semantic Versioning].

## [1.3.0] / 2021-11-29

* Distribute ARM binaries.

## [1.2.0] / 2020-07-07

* Preserve environment variables that the glibc loader automatically strips from
  the environment when executing a setuid binary like autouseradd. The most
  notable such environment variable is `TMPDIR`. As a side effect, autouseradd
  learned a new option, `-e NAME=VALUE`, which sets the environment variable
  `NAME` to `VALUE`.

  For more details about the environment variables stripped by the loader,
  see the references to "secure-execution mode" in the [ld.so man page][ld.so].

  specified.

## [1.1.0] / 2018-07-31

Learn to skip creating a home directory when the `--no-create-home` option, or
its short form, `-M`, is specified.

## 1.0.0 / 2017-11-07

Initial release.
