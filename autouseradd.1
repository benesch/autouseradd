.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBautouseradd\fR adds a user and a group named after that user to the system,
then invokes \fIcommand\fR with the specified \fIargs\fR.
If \fIcommand\fR is omitted, the user's login shell is invoked instead.
The real user ID and the real group ID of the process are used as the user ID

the same name or ID already exists.
